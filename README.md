# Linked List Visualizer made with Vue3 + Typescript + Tailwind CSS

This is a very simple Linked List Visualizer built with Vue3 composition APIs and Typescript for type safety. Used Linked List Data Structure for the Data Models and Vue3 Recursive components to present it in the UI.

# Features implemented so far

- Append
- Prepend
- Searching with animations
- Reverse
- Save Linked Link Data in Browser's Local Storage

## Notes

While viewing the demo hosted in Netlify, it might warn that this is a `dangerous` website and you shouldn't visit it. But I can confirm that it is a false alarm. I think, your browser flags it as dangerous as it attemps to save fairly large amount of data in your local storage (Obviously upon your approval).
